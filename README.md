# OthelloGame-PythonProject
- Project Details:
1. This was my final project for Intensive Foundations in CS course(CS5001) at Northeastern University Seattle.
2. Requirement was to design the Othello Game in Python and to make the computer(AI) player more efficient in its moves than the player
   playing against the AI player.
3. To make the AI more efficient, I made sure to flip maximum tiles when the AI has its turn.
4. I have used Processing IDE to build the ChessBoard Interface for the Game.
5. Finally I display the winner and also how many tiles each player owns when the Game is over.

- Steps to play the game:
1. Open othello_game_starter.pyde in Processing IDE and click run
2. It displays the chessboard iterface to play the game.
3. The details of how the game is played can be found at  https://www.othelloonline.org/
